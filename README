This is suite of tests for checking speed of number crushing in
server-side interpreted programs, server-side compiled programs and
in browser-running JavaScript.

Pre-requisites to run all tests:
* Perl 5
* Python 2.7
* Python 3.0
* node.js
* R and Rscript
* Mongo shell (needs server running somewhere)
* Java compiler and runtime
* gcc and standard C libs
* make program


To re-generate data remove dat files from output dir and issue make
command. To generate summary.csv run summary R script. Summary will
pick up any sub-directories and *.dat files in them. Copy-paste
results from browser to appropriate locations to include them into
summary.csv (which eventually will be sorted by "Total Time" column)
